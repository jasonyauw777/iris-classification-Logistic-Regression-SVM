Iris Classification

The dataset used is the Iris dataset used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple
Measurements in Taxonomic Problem. The Iris dataset consists of 3 iris species with 50 samples
each and properties of each of the flowers.

The 3 iris species are Iris-virginica, Iris-versicolor and Iris-setosa. The Machine Learning algorithms 
used to solve the problem is Logistic Regression and SVM. Feature engineering is applied to the data
by using Z-score normalization. The data is split 70/30, 70% training and 30% test data. SVM model has 
an accuracy score of 100% and Logistic Regression model has accuracy of 93%. The models are ensured to be 
not overfitting or underfitting.
